Moldyworks Lab
==============

This is my personal dump for small experiments and proofs of concepts for larger projects. The code can more or less be divided into three categories:

- Drupal, for all Drupal related work. This is mostly legacy as my current job doesn't work with this CMS
- HTML5, for all HTML5 and CSS3 related work. This is primarily Canvas and d3js work, with some experiments in CSS-only drawing and animations coming soon
- JavaScript. Random pure JS/JQuery experiments and doodles
- MVC, in relation to client-side MVC. Backbone and Angular work.
