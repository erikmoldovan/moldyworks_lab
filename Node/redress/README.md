This is a social network built in NodeJS/Express, MongoDB and BackboneJS. The end goal is to create a self contained server/client bundled in a mobile app wrapper that can communicated over secure peer-to-peer connections, needing a central server only to acquire IPs of other users of the social network; All actual data is transferred between clients. This is an imitation of the torrent system.
